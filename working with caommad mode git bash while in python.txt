what is unitest module in python

The unittest module in Python is a built-in library for creating and running tests for your code.
It provides a framework for writing test cases, organizing them into test suites, and executing those tests
 to ensure that your code behaves as expected.

Key Features of unittest:
Test Cases: You can create test cases by subclassing unittest.TestCase. 
Each method in the class that starts with the word "test" will be considered a test.

Assertions: The module provides various assertion methods, 
such as assertEqual(), assertTrue(), assertFalse(), assertRaises(), and more, to check for expected outcomes.

Test Suites: You can group multiple test cases into a test suite for organized execution.

Test Runner: You can run your tests using the built-in test runner, which can be done from the command line or programmatically.

Test Discovery: It can automatically discover tests in your project based on naming conventions.
